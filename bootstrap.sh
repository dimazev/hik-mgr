# Runs once every time the container actually starts (not at `docker
# build` time) — see the Dockerfile for why: node_modules is never copied
# into the image, so this is where it gets installed, fresh, against
# whatever Node/OS/arch this specific container is running on. That
# matters most for native modules like better-sqlite3, which otherwise
# risk being a precompiled binary baked in under one environment and then
# loaded under a subtly different one.
